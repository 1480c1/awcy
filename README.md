Are We Compressed Yet?
====
This repository contains the arewecompressedyet.com website source code.

Running your own local copy of the website
===
To run a local copy, you will need to install node.js on your computer and create a configuration file called config.json in your awcy Git directory.
This configuration file contains only one setting right now, which is the IRC channel that the AWCY bot will join:

  { "channel": "#daalatest" }

You also need to install some node.js modules that get used by awcy.
Open a node command line and run the following:
```
  npm install aws-sdk
  npm install body-parser
  npm install cookie-parser
  npm install express
  npm install irc
```
To run the server, execute the run_awcy.bat file
or run the following in your command line:
```
  node awcy_server.js
```
Now you can open localhost:3000 with your browser to see your local version of the website.

Run database format
===
The runs/ directory will contain all of the output files generated from a job. There is a info.json file that specifies what options were used by that particular run. Here is an example of an info.json file:

  {"codec":"daala","commit":"","run_id":"2014-09-19T22-00-08.196Z","task":"video-1-short","nick":"AWCY","task_type":"video"}

There is also an output.txt file that contains the output of the rd_tool.py script.

After each run, a cache file called list.json file is generated by the generate_list.js script. This contains all of the info.json files, as an ordered list. This should probably be replaced by a "real" database at some point.
