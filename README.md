Are We Compressed Yet?
====
This repository contains the arewecompressedyet.com website source code. To run a local copy, you will need a configuration file called config.json in the current directory. This configuration file contains only one setting right now, which is the IRC channel that the AWCY bot will join:

  { "channel": "#daalatest" }

To run the server, run with your local node binary:

  node awcy_server.js
  
  
Run database format
===
The runs/ directory will contain all of the output files generated from a job. There is a info.json file that specifies what options were used by that particular run. Here is an example of an info.json file:

  {"codec":"daala","commit":"","run_id":"2014-09-19T22-00-08.196Z","task":"video-1-short","nick":"AWCY","task_type":"video"}

There is also an output.txt file that contains the output of the rd_tool.py script.

After each run, a cache file called list.json file is generated by the generate_list.js script. This contains all of the info.json files, as an ordered list. This should probably be replaced by a "real" database at some point.
